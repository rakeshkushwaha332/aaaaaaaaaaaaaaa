## Data Structures

### Time & Space Complexity
- Order of growth: `2^n`, `n^(log n)`, `n log n`, `n^(3/2)`
- Most efficient loop (log n vs linear)
- Classic loop time complexity analysis (nested, decreasing, amortized O(n))

### Arrays
- Longest odd-even subsequence
- Repeated & missing number (linear time, O(1) space)
- Rotate string/array
- Add one to number (array digits)
- Max even - min odd
- Update array with neighbor products
- And 70+ more classic array problems

### 2D Arrays
- Matrix addition, subtraction, transpose
- Scalar & matrix multiplication
- Rotate 90° clockwise (in-place)
- Spiral matrix generation
- Concentric rectangular pattern
- Determinant (2x2, 3x3)
- Identity / triangular matrix checks

---

## Strings

- Case conversion (upper ↔ lower)
- Reverse words / entire string
- Palindrome checks (recursive & iterative)
- Longest substring without repeating chars
- Minimum window substring
- Custom ATOI implementation
- Colorful number
- Amazing substrings (vowels)
- Add binary strings
- Period of string (KMP-style)
- Rearrange to avoid boring substrings

---

## Bit Manipulation

- Single number (appears once, others twice/thrice)
- Minimum XOR pair
- Total Hamming distance (all pairs)

---

## Recursion

- Fibonacci / Factorial
- Palindrome check
- Print 1 to N / N to 1
- Tower of Hanoi style problems
- Tricky output prediction questions
- Reverse stack using recursion

---

## Sorting & Searching

- Merge sort, Quick sort implementation
- Count inversions (Merge Sort)
- Aggressive cows, Book allocation
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Peak element, Square root (binary search)
- Matrix search (row-column sorted)

---

## Two Pointers & Sliding Window

- 3Sum closest, pair with given sum/diff
- Trapping rain water
- Longest substring without repeat
- Sort colors (0,1,2) Dutch National Flag
- Subarray with given sum

---

## Hashing

- Zero-sum subarray (longest/first)
- 2-sum, 4-sum variants
- First repeating element
- Count pairs with difference K
- Common elements in two arrays
- Colorful number, Anagrams

---

## Stacks & Queues

- Balanced parentheses
- Next greater element
- Sliding window maximum (Deque)
- Reverse stack (recursive & using queue)
- First non-repeating character in stream
- Gas station (circular queue logic)
- Design stack with getMin()

---

## Advanced / Must-Know

- Trapping Rain Water
- Merge Overlapping Intervals
- Maximum Chunks to Make Sorted
- Important Reverse Pairs (A[i] > 2*A[j])
- Nested cylinders (Greedy stacking)
- Beggars outside temple (Difference array)
- Next permutation (in-place)
